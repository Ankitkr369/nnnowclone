i have created the clone of nnnow.com using html css and javascript.


I used HTML, CSS, Javascript and other libraries to clone it.The libraries like jquerry , bootstrap ,flickity ,owl-carousel, and i used fontawesome and google fonts for icon and fonts.

HOME PAGE

I made Home page in which we see some trending wears and some navigation bar which contens mens womens and kids. each menu item is linked to a page to its relevent page. like mens section contains all the elements of mens wear.

Login page

I made login authentication with email password functionality using Javascript. user first enter thier email address if they are registred they go to password section else they go to create account section.
